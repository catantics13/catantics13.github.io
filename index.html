        <h1>An ANFIS-based System</h1>

        <p>Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Information Systems provide an optimum combination of expert-base decision making tools and machine learning.</p>
        <p>The ANFIS classifier allows user-defined funtional forms between the training data and the labels, but the functions are parameterized by training the model on real world data.</p>
        <p>For phenomena such as flooding in SAR images where the relationship between backscatter and inundation is known, this unique property provides an ideally suited opportunity to utilise expert knowledge while leveraging data to calibrate the model.</p>

        <h2>Optimized Texture for Single SAR Images</h2>

        <p>In addition to the neuro-fuzzy classifier the algorithm also utilizes optimized texture features.</p>

        <p>Omnidirectional grey level co-occurrence matrices are calculated, which can be interpreted as 2D-histograms of an image.</p>

        <p>These are then fed into a dimensionality reduction technique such as the Independent Component Transform to maximize the information content in the minimum number of bands.</p>

        <p>The optimized texture layers are added to the SAR image prior to processing to reduce uncertainties with minimum dependencies on ancillary datasets.</p>


        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>

        <p>
          The image below shows a comparison between flood maps manually delineated from very high resolution optical aerial photographs (Validation),
          those prepared with SAR only (SAR), those enhanced with standard textures used for flood mapping in literature, e.g. variance and
          mean Euclidean distance (Std+SAR), and the right-most panel shows the results for the proposed algorithm (Opt+SAR). </p>
